# UserQuizApp
An ASP .NET Core Web API app that allows authorized users to partake in assigned quizzes

The app has a dockerfile, so it should be possible to launch it in a container

The app consists of two parts - backend ASP .NET Core Web API that uses a PostgreSQL code-first database with Entity Framework Core,
and a frontend part - a React multi-page app that uses React Redux and React Router, as well as Tailwind CSS styles.

To launch frontend - go to the user-quiz-app-react folder and execute npm start
